# AI Friend Frontend (Next.js)

This is a minimal Next.js frontend that talks to the backend API at `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` (defaults to `http://localhost:4000/api`).

Quick start (Windows cmd.exe)

1. From repository root, install frontend deps:

```cmd
cd frontend
npm install
```

2. Start frontend in dev:

```cmd
npm run dev
```

3. Ensure backend is running on the API base (default http://localhost:4000). You can set the backend address with the environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE`.

Notes
- The frontend is intentionally minimal and mobile-first. It provides: register/login, create AI friends, select a friend, and chat.
- For the pitch I can style this further (Tailwind, animations), add persistence (localStorage), and add Socket.IO for realtime messages.
